# Introduction
ESP32-WiFi camera module Lite is an AI vision solution designed for DIY project development. Based on the ESP32-S3 chip, it integrates WiFi/Bluetooth, on board 2MP amera and antenna, some custom buttons, and provides serial and IIC interfaces. It can work independently as a minimum system board, or it can be installed on a smart car or robot with a 2DOF PTZ for real-time video transmission and AI visual recognition. ESP32-WiFi camera module can send out WiFi hotspots by itself to achieve real-time video transmission by LAN, and users can also connect it to their own router network. Yahboom provides some AI visual recognition routines, FPV control APP, and many tutorials for connecting and using with a variety of MCU (STM32, micro:bit, AR, Raspberry Pi Pico, MSPM0, etc.).
# Features
* The latest Orin NX carrier board is perfectly compatible with Nvidia's Jetson Orin NX core module, with reasonable layout and stable performance.
* Developer kit includes a 256GB M.2 SSD solid-state drive, WiFi network card antenna, and power supply.
* Compared with Jetson Xavier NX, Jetson Orin NX interface resources are optimized and upgraded, the performance is improved by 3~5 times, and the memory read and write speed is doubled.
* Based on the Ubuntu 20.04 system, Yahboom provides many ROS and AI vision related tutorials and open source codes.
* HD video transmission: The module comes with 2MP camera module, using COMS image sensing technology, allowing users to capture clearer images and videos to meet your project needs.
* Image recognition and processing: It integrates the ESP32-S3 chip, low-power dual-core 32-bit CPU, 240MHz main frequency, and computing power up to 600MIPS. Combined with the video images captured by the camera, it can complete functions such as face recognition, color recognition, and QR code recognition.
* Support switching between two network models:
AP mode: The mobile phone or computer connects to the module built-in WiFi hotspot, and the video image transmission is viewed in real time on the mobile phone APP or web page.
STA mode: Connect the module to the user's own WiFi network through the serial port configuration, and view the video image transmission in real time on the mobile phone APP or web page.
* Easily expandable: It comes with PH2.0 model IIC and serial interface, which can connect to a variety of main control boards (STM32, micro:bit, AR, Raspberry Pi Pico, MSPM0, etc.).
* Suitable for education and academic research: As open source hardware, ESP32 board with camera module has been widely used in the fields of education and academic research for teaching experiments or prototype development.
