If there is a freeze during use, it may be that the serial port power supply is insufficient. 
You need to power the ESP32 camera separately. 
At the same time, unplug the 5V connection between the ESP32 camera and the motherboard, and only connect the other three wires.
如果在使用过程出现卡顿可能是串口供电不足，需要单独给esp32 摄像头供电，同时拔下ESP32 摄像头与主板的5V 接线，只连接其余三根线
